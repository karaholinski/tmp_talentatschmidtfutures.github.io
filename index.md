## Welcome to Rise Research

The moment we're in calls for a radical reexamination on the part of elite institutions. 

For years we've been asking whether a college education can really be worth the cost, a rough $200,000 for four years. Even when the sticker price is reduced by financial aid, the main attraction of the modern university has been a vague and formless 'package' of attractive goods. Some are educational - classes, teachers, and research facilities. But some are decidedly not - networks, peers, conversations, 'the college experience'. 

And the more the sticker price grows, the more premium we place on the 'experience'. There's a well-documented trail of American univerisites, in particular, sweetening this 'experience' by building expensive pools, stadiums, in one case a 'lazy river' on which floating co-eds can drink and relax. (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/15/are-lazy-rivers-and-climbing-walls-driving-cost-college) It's no longer clear what came first: the campus experience, or the student debt. 

This has been accompanied by understandable skepticism on the part of the American public. Humanities programs have been aware of this trend for years: there has been at least a 30% decline in philosophy, language, English, history, and religion majors since 2000 (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/). 

But what happens to an elite institution when a global pandemic forces campuses - those magical, expensive experiences - to shut down? 

The result in an amazing upward spike in students deferring a year rather than pay $50,000 for a glorified online course; one in six high schoolers now say they won't attend for fall 2020 [https://hechingerreport.org/coronavirus-fears-are-about-to-produce-the-biggest-gap-year-ever-for-college-students/]. And students who experienced this past semester partly remote have even sued, notably at Harvard Law, for failure to concomitantly lower tuition [https://abcnews.go.com/US/abc-news-exclusive-harvard-law-student-sues-university/story?id=71345292]. And Ivy Leagues, those juggernauts of non-technical diplomas, now label the advent of corona virus a 'double blow' to humanities enrollment, the former mainstay of the liberal arts: https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/05/the-great-recession-strangled-the-humanities-will-coronavirus-deal-the-last-blow?fbclid=IwAR3r1vhF--pl_D9P_ZVtGTEXihqRI1XvZZj5VFt1t1xBbdfqVS5EmQ3PkBU. 

Before Covid-19, it was just humanities programs backed into a corner, justifying their existence. Now universities must plead their case to the public for the worth they bring to every student. This skepticism extends to and includes elite fellowships. What does Harvard, Wharton, or the Marshall bring to participants beyond the sought-after enamel of the elite? 

There's actually very little proof that a fancy degree increases your chances in life, particularly for those already belonging to the upper crust. [Data from UT Austin]. Even the Rhodes Scholarhsip uses its scholars as proof of its pudding, without comparing their outcomes to those of runners-up. The data on the marginal benefit of these laurel wreaths has been ignored.  

Coupled with corona virus is a growing public movement to expand opportunities to non-traditional and underrepresented populations. So, in addition to the insane cost and unproven worth of these experiences, there's the looming question of justice - to whom should such experiences truly be given? 

All these existential questions will have to be answered if elite institutions hope to survive and thrive. Our research project can't hope to answer all of them. However, we are concerned with the pipeline that leads to entry to these institutions and elite fellowships. Are the ways that we evaluate students fair? Are they accurate? Are they cost-effective? 

We've discussed [here] what our research entails and why we're interested. But it's worth asking what 'signal' elite institutions and fellowships currently use to distinguish which candidates are 'most worthy'; because, ultimately, the lack of faith in the current system is in part due to whom these opportunities are being offered.
